# 🌿 Manava-Swabhavalu

**Manava-Swabhavalu** (మనవ స్వభావాలు — “Human Nature”) is a research-driven, data-centric project aimed at laying the foundation for the first Telugu Large Language Model (LLM).  
The goal is to enable AI to *understand and generate Telugu content* that reflects **deep human emotions, personality traits, and cultural nuance**, rather than simply translating from other languages.

---

## 🎯 Motivation & Vision

- **Why a Telugu LLM?**  
  Most existing language models focus on global or major languages, often missing out on the emotional richness and cultural context embedded in regional languages like Telugu. Manava-Swabhavalu aims to bridge that gap.

- **Beyond words — modeling human nature**  
  Rather than focusing solely on grammar or literal translation, this project seeks to represent how Telugu speakers express emotions, humor, empathy, sarcasm, cultural norms, and behavioral traits — enabling AI that resonates with native speakers.

## 📚 What This Project Does

- Curates a **Telugu-centric dataset** capturing conversational and emotional language.  
- Defines an **annotation schema** to tag personality traits, emotional tone, cultural context.  
- Implements data cleaning, preprocessing, and tokenization pipelines tailored for Telugu.  
- Provides **reference scripts/notebooks** to train and evaluate models — aiming for a base model equipped for Telugu emotional and cultural understanding.  
- Documents methodology and guidelines to ensure **ethical, respectful, and culturally-sensitive** AI generation.
